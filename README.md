# WebApp_Project_appPictureLibrary
This was a collaborative project created by the amazing Julius Thomsen, Toros Kutlu and Patrik Johansson! 
The goal was to create an HTML based webapp that serves as a picture library where the user can see various images, edit their values AND rate them. 


If you'd like to test/try the app, simply download the project as a zip-file, start the 'workspace' with your editor of choice and launch "landingPage.html" 
as a local server 
(I would strongly recommend Visual studio code as your IDE and using an extension like "Live server" to launch this webapp)
